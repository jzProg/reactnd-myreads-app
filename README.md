# MyReads Project

My implementation of the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter) was used as initial template.

## Setup Instructions

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* build with `npm run build`
* start the development server with `npm start`
